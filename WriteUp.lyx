\begin_layout Title
Computing Methodologies III â€“ Numerical Algorithms
\end_layout

\begin_layout Section*
Step One
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Start with a set number of particles and timesteps, using a random number
 generator each particle is given an x, y and z coordinate.
 The interaction will start by iterating through every particle in the simulatio
n, for each one calculating the euclidian distance from the current particle
 and each other particle and using this distance to calculate the force
 on the current particle, this will then be split into its constituent parts,
 x,y and z.
 These are summated to give the total force in each direction for each particle.
 Whilst iterating through each particle pair, the shortest distance between
 any particle pair is stored, this will be used to calculate the timestep,
 intially the time step is set to the minimum possible value.
 A variable timestep is used because of the tendency of particle to accelerate
 together, due to the implementation it will do this in jumps, if the timestep
 is too large then the particle will pass each other without the particles
 ever being close enough to repel and will thus not be an accurate model.
 The way that I calculate the timestep is based on experimental data, I
 set two particles at closer and closer distances together and set a timestep
 that I thought was acceptable, I then created a stepped timestep such that
 if the shortest distance between any two particle pairs was between two
 thresholds then the timestep would change based on this, and when the distance
 dropped bellow the lower threshold then the timestep would change, this
 was jerky with the particles accelerating together then coming to a halt
 as the timestep changed.
 To overcome the stepping I plotted threshold/timstep points and used a
 line of best fit to give me the equation of the line that would best fit
 the threshods I had found.
 The equation happened to be the shortest distance^(2.7469) * 10^10.
 This was accurate above a distance of 0.00015 at this point just the minimum
 distance was usedas the timestep, this allows high accuracy at very short
 distances.
 The only other feature of the simulation is periodic bounding, I had done
 this by modulo mathematics but this introduced a few issues, so decided
 that comparision was faster and more reliable.
 The comparisions are done is such a way that they are used every time a
 particle has its coordinates changed.

\begin_layout Section*
Step Two
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
- N = 2, 1 at 0.4 2 at 0.6 with no velocity
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
- occilation at variable time steps
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
- at low time steps the particals initally don't move at all for a very
 long time then when they do eventually come together and occilate as they
 do in the variable timestep simulation
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
- at high time steps the particles will pass each other then come back and
 this will cause some issues
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
- they will initally come together and then each of the different timesteps
 will have it's own effect, if they oscilate they will do so around the
 0.5 mark
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
-
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
- at 0.1 and 0.9 they will do the same but the ocilation point will be 0.0
 due to the periodic bounding conditions
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
- everything else will be the same
\end_layout

Step Three
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
- talk about what we implemented, verlet lists
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
- the results doesn't change for variable time steps
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
- for large time steps - 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
